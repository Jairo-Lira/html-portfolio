        <h1>Jairo's Movie Ranking</h1>
        <br>

        <p>
            In this list I will be ranking my top 5 favorite movies of all time. I will tell you
            a little bit about what the movie is about and perhaps some interesting facts about it.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><h3>#1 Whiplash</h3></li>
            <br>

                In this movie we get to know Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a young student drummer
                whose career changes after crossing paths with Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons).
                Andy pushes himself beyond his limits improving as a musician but becomes obsesed
                with being "one of the greats" as he is challenged by Fletcher on every competence they're in.
            </p>
            <li><h3>#2 Oppenheimer</h3></li>
            <br>

            <p>
                Academy Award director Christopher Nolan tells us the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer in a
                way that navigates us through one of the events that changed human history. Cillian Murphy
                portrays this role in such a way that makes us feel empathy for Robert as he has moral regrets
                after leading his team in WW2.
            </p>
            <li><h3>#3 Green Book</h3></li>
            <br>

            <p>
                It's hard for me to tell who the main protagonist is in this story since both Don Shirley and Tony
                Vallelonga are really interesting characters. In this journey we get to hear some incredible music 
                and see a friendship be born between these two formidable characters.
            </p>
            <li><h3>#4 Jurassic Park</h3></li>
            <br>
            <img src="../assets/images/movie-pics/jurassicPark.jpeg" alt="" width="300px" height="230px">
            <p>
                In this Steven Spielberg classic we see an adaptation of Michaels Chricton's novel in a way that 
                leaves us terrified of facing one of these prehistoric creatures. We will root for every one of the 
                characters and I'm sure you'll be amazed by how realistic dinosaurs look in this film.
            </p>
            <li><h3>#5 Back to the Future</h3></li>
            <br>

            <p>
                "If you're going to build a time machine, why not to do it with style?". In this 80's classic we join
                Marty McFly and Doc. Emmet Brown in a journey through time on which they will have to repair some problems 
                by changing some events in the past, but they'll soon find out that perhaps they changed more than they
                meant.
